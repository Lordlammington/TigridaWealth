Wealth management is often misunderstood as a service only for millionaires. In reality, it benefits anyone who:


-   Has multiple financial goals (e.g. retirement, kids’ education, business exit).
-   Needs tax-efficient planning.
-   Wants peace of mind knowing a professional is managing the big picture.
-   Faces complex decisions like pension consolidation or inheritance planning.

Whether you have £100,000 or £10 million, smart planning can help protect and grow what you’ve worked hard to earn.
