## How to Prepare Your Family for Inheritance

Transferring wealth isn’t just a legal process—it’s a family journey. To ensure your legacy endures:

-   Start the conversation early with your children or beneficiaries.
-   Educate the next generation on financial responsibility.
-   Use trusts to protect assets and control how and when they’re distributed.
-   Document your intentions through wills and letters of wishes.
-   Involve professionals (solicitors, tax advisers, wealth managers) to ensure everything is coordinated.

Ultimately, good planning reduces friction and helps preserve not only wealth, but family harmony.
